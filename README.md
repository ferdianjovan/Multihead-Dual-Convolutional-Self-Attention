# Multihead Dual Convolutional Self Attention (MDCSA)

## Notes from the authors

Pytorch implementation of MDCSA. The network was designed and tested to perform indoor room-level localisation on people with Parkinson diseases. The script / notebook can be run on a dummy dataset that imitates the whereabouts of a pair of people around 2 hours. Hence, results in this repository may not reflect the performance of the network on our real-world dataset.

Pytorch version: 1.10.0 (may be compatible with higher/lower versions)
